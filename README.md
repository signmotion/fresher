Requests and suggestions are warmly welcome.

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a great place to learn, create, take a new skills, and be inspired.

If this is your first contribution, I'll leave you with some of the best links I've found: they will help you get started or/and become even more efficient.

The package **Fresher** is open-source, stable and well-tested. Development happens on
[GitHub](https://github.com/signmotion/fresher). Feel free to report issues
or create a pull-request there.

General questions are best asked on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fresher).

And here is a curated list of how you can help:

- Documenting the undocumented. Whenever you come across a class, property, or method within our codebase that you're familiar with and notice it lacks documentation, kindly spare a couple of minutes to jot down some helpful notes for your fellow developers.
- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.
- Sharing your examples. If you've experimented with our use cases or have crafted some examples of your own, feel free to add them to the `example` directory. Your practical insights can enrich our resource pool.
- Fix typos/grammar mistakes.
- Report bugs and scenarios that are difficult to implement.
- Implement new features by making a pull-request.

## üïßTODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **Fresher**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Use a [fixed with emojis](https://github.com/jonahwilliams/mustache/pull/6/files) mustache
  instead `EmojiTemplate`.

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
